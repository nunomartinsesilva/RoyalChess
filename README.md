# RoyalChess

RoyalChess is a fully functional chess engine that allows you to challenge your chess friends locally. This engine was built using core Java, Swing GUI and jUnit for testing.

The GUI takes the current game state and displays it on the screen. As of today, it only supports click-click movement and right click to reset piece selection.
Drag and drop soon to be added in a future update.


### How to Run
Run the .jar file at RoyalChess/target, either by double clicking or by running
```
java -jar RoyalChess-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
on a terminal window.



### Known Bugs
+ Move history panel takes one move to reset, after hitting "play again" button.
+ Some moves do not display on Move history panel.


### Future Updates
+ Sound Effects.
+ GUI revamp (cleaner, faster UI, allows Drag and Drop moves).
+ Piece promotion panel (currently, any Pawn will be promoted automatically to a Queen).
+ Move timer.
+ Bigger choice of options (window resolution, mute/unmute, piece/board art and more).
+ Remote Play.
+ Player Account (saves elo, match history).
